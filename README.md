# Augmented RandomS Search (ARS)

The ARS algorithm is a recent addition to the AI body of knowledge, posited in March 2018 by [Mania *et al.*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07055.pdf). Unlike other AI algorithms, in general, ARS:

+ shifts the exploration frontier to the policy space from the action space
+ employs the finite difference method over the common gradient descent method
+ utilizes shallow learning instead of deep learning

ARS has been found to produce powerful results at faster speeds and higher rewards (for specific use cases) and does not demand performance beyond that of a home computer.
